Learning how to create games is certaintly fun but obviously challenging.

How was I going to tackle this project as a new comer?

First thing to think about was how I wanted to structure this game and what I would do first.

Naturally the thing I was struggling with the most was coding so I decided to deal with that aspect first.

Used some cube assets from unity just have something to test the code on. Although for the type of game I was making I decided it would be best to leave the platforms as is.

The character the player played as however of course had to be changed but that was a problem for later.

I started off with the simplest work of code which was making the character move.

Once completed I then made the two scripts that allowed the platfomes to change. 

The tile script and the gamemanager script.

script was a little rough but almost complete.

I then decided to focus on making the title screen.

Game was looking good mostly everything worked the way it was supposed to.

Still trying to figure out some bugs. 

Player infinitely jumping bug : status - mostly fixed.

game continuing after gameover : status - not fixed

will continue to work on to find out why

Game has no sound

music track for game - in progress.
